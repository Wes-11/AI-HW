# AI-HW
My goal with this prokect was to use better heuristics to beat a friends attempt, who used simulated annealing,
at the same problem with the same data set in less time and greater accuracy. This was faster but not in a consistent manner,
sometimes it was twice as fast and others only a few miliseconds. As far as accuracy goes it never beat simulated annealing
